I am a postdoc at the Hugues Abriel laboratory of the University of Bern, Switzerland.  
I work on the field of ion channels. Specifically, I am interested in the biophysical properties of the cardiac voltage-gated sodium channel Na<sub>v</sub>1.5 and how they can be regualted by its protein partners.
