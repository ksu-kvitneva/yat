I am a researcher at the Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine of the University of Bern,
Switzerland.  

My research work focuses on the field of ion channels and their role in different pathologies. In
particular, I study how various protein partners of cardiac ion channels regulate their biophysical
properties contributing to arrhythmias in the heart.  

I am originally from Ukraine. There, I completed my undergraduate studies in Biology at Taras
Shevchenko National University of Kyiv. Afterwards, I moved to the United Kingdom for Masters in
Biochemical Research program at Imperial College London and to France to do my PhD at the
University of Lille. In 2020 I came to Switzerland for my postdoctoral research.
